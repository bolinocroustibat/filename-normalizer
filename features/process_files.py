    """Process files that need renaming and return counts of renamed, skipped, and already correct files.

    This function handles both files with dates in their names and PDF files without dates.
    For files with dates, it will clean the filename and rename it to YYYY-MM-DD format.
    For PDF files without dates, it will extract dates from their content using OpenAI.

        console: Console object for output

    Returns:

            - Number of files that were renamed
            - Number of files that were skipped (user declined or error)
